Movie Recommendation Engine
Jun 2020 â€“ Aug 2020

Project descriptionThis is a content-based movie recommendation engine.
The project is inspired from the projects of Krish Naik.

The movies dataset was obtained and processed from https://www.themoviedb.org/ and Wikipedia respectively.
The project is created using the Flask framework and deployed on Heroku.

The similarity score is calculated using Cosine Similarity.
Cosine similarity is a metric used to measure how similar the documents are irrespective of their size. Mathematically, it measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors projected in a multi-dimensional space. The cosine similarity is advantageous because even if the two similar documents are far apart by the Euclidean distance (due to the size of the document), chances are they may still be oriented closer together. The smaller the angle, higher the cosine similarity.
